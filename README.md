This project was created by Seahorse 0.2.5.

# Seahorse Token Program
The Objective of this tutorial is to get started with SPL Tokens with seahorse. We will learn about TokenMints and TokenAccounta and how to use them to mint tokens,transfer tokens to other user's TokenAccount. To is to create a **Lottery smart contract** where users can buy lottery tickets and a random winner will be selected from all participants and lottery prize will be rewarded to the winner.

## Prerequisites
We need to install some command line tools for this project to build. We need [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools), [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html#install-rust), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Seahorse](https://seahorse-lang.org/docs/installation). The links provided contain the step-by-step guide on installing these tools and the dependencies required for them like Rust.

You can check if package got installed correctly by running command like :

`solana -V`
`anchor -V`
`seahorse -V`

For this project, the version used are :
* anchor 0.25.0

* seahorse v0.2.5

* node 19.0.0

## Getting started with Seahorse
We initialize Seahorse Project using command `seahorse init token_program`. This will create a project directory with multiple files which is mostly similar to anchor projects, just will write our seahorse program in `token_program/programs_py/token_program.py`

## Involved Accounts
There are 2 types of accounts involved here, which are **TokenMint** and **TokenAccount**. The Manager is responsible for creating the Lottery and its parameters like lottery price and calling the random winner from all lottery buyers. On the other hand, Users are the people who are buying the lottery. 
These whole thing is described very nicely in below presentaion.

## Program Instructions
We have 4 functions/instructions in this Program. Let's understand all the different Program instructions one by one.

### 1. initTokenMint
When someone wants to create a new token, we have to use something create-token function to initialize a new Mint Account. `initTokenMint` is the function where we create our TokenMint Accounts. TokenMint account contains the following informations: 
* `mint-authority` which is a public-key (pubkey) authorized to mint this token
*  the number of `decimals` of the token etc. 
```
def init_token_mint(new_token_mint: Empty[TokenMint], signer: Signer):
  new_token_mint.init(
    payer = signer,
    seeds = ['token-mint', signer],
    decimals = 0,
    authority = signer
  )
  ```
This account stores general information about the token and who has permissions over it. Observe that there is no data about token holdings of particular individuals. These are stored in Token Accounts.

### 2. initTokenAccount
The token account holds information about the tokens owned by a pubkey. Ownership relationships become a bit confusing, though. The token account itself is owned by the Token program and it is the Token program who controls access to these tokens using the owner, and delegate fields within the account. The owner is the pubkey who can spend/transfer the tokens, and the owner can give rights to a delegate pubkey to spend up to a delegatedAmount of tokens. 
The TokenAccount has number of fields like:
* mint - this is the mint whose tokens this this account will hold
* authority - the account that has authority over this account
```
def init_token_account(new_token_account: Empty[TokenAccount],recipient: Empty[TokenAccount],
                       mint: TokenMint,signer: Signer):
  new_token_account.init(payer = signer, seeds = ['token-account1', signer],
                         mint = mint, authority = signer)
  recipient.init(payer = signer, seeds = ['token-account2', signer],
                         mint = mint, authority = signer)
```

### 3. useTokenMint
The mint authority can mint tokens for any user. This process updates both, the userâ€™s balance (in the token-account) and the supply (in the mint account). To mint tokens we use the mint subcommand of spl-token as follows:

</p>

```
def use_token_mint(mint: TokenMint,recipient: TokenAccount,signer: Signer):
  mint.mint(authority = signer,
    to = recipient,
    amount = u64(3000)
  )
  ```
  
  Additionally, we can burn some parts of minted tokens also.Like below, we are burning 1000 tokens from the `recipient` account from his 3000 minted tokens above (so after this instruction, recipient` will gain exactly 2000 token.)
  But recipient_signer` must be the authority for the `recipient` token account.
  ```
    mint.burn( authority = recipient_signer,
    holder = recipient, amount = 1000
  )
  ```

### 4. useTokenAccount

```
def use_token_account(signer_account: TokenAccount, recipient: TokenAccount,signer: Signer):
  signer_account.transfer( authority = signer,
    to = recipient, amount = 100 )
```
